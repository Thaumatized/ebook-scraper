### Ebook Scraper

Hi!

This scraper is used to convert ebooks into images for printing.

To use install pillow and pynput and call
> python3 ebookScraper.py

the instructions will take you from there.

### PDF generation

no one wants to print hundreds of images one by one, so make them into a pdf and print them at once.

To make the images into a pdf call
> python3 pdfGenerator.py

the instructions will take you from there.

### Future plans

I want to replace pyautogui with just pillow and pynput, since pynput should allow for everything I need from pyautogui except screenshot. Pyautogui is a leftover from when this project used keyboard and wasn't compatible with linux for that reason.
